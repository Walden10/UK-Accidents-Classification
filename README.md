# UK-Accidents-Classification

This project makes use of the data published by the United Kingdom road safety agencies to identify pertinent features that are significant for fatal accidents. This is for an exploratory perspective to help policymakers identify what kind of pre-determined attributes (such as roads or vehicles) are most susceptible to a fatal accident.

This repository will contain two parts. The first part includes initial data processing, and exploratory visualization. The second part trains and evaluates models.

*This project also includes geo-spatial visualization using folium

The following ML methods are trained and evaluated:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
- ADA - Boost
